<h2>介绍</h2></a>
<blockquote><b>visualgc</b> 工具附着到插桩过的HotSpot JVM, 收集并图形化的展示垃圾收集, 类加载以及
HotSpot 编译器的性能数据.
  <p>
The target JVM is identified by its virtual machine identifier, or
<b>vmid</b>. The formatting and semantics of the <b>vmid</b> are
described in the <a href="#vmidoption"><i>vmid</i></a> option section below.
</blockquote>

<a name="options">
<h2>OPTIONS</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The <b>visualgc</b> takes the following options:
<dl>
<a name="vmidoption"></a>
    <dt><b>vmid</b>
        <dd>A string that indicates the target JVM. The
            syntax of the <b>vmid</b> string largely corresponds to the
            syntax of a URI.  The general syntax is
            <blockquote>
            <dl>
            <dt> [<i>protocol</i>:][//]<b><i>lvmid</i></b>[@<i>hostname</i>[:<i>port</i>]/<i>servername</i>]
            </dl>
            </blockquote>
            which allows virtual machine identifiers to vary from a simple
            integer representing a local virtual machine identifier to a
            more complex construction specifying a communications protocol,
            port number, and other implementation specific values. See the
            <a href="notes.html#vmidentifier">Virtual Machine Identifier</a>
            section for more details.

<a name="intervaloption"></a>
    <p>
    <dt><b>interval[ms|s]</b>
        <dd>An integer value indicating the sampling interval. The default
            units is <i>ms</i> (milliseconds). If omitted, the default
            <i>interval</i> is 500 milliseconds.

<h2>OUTPUT FORMAT</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The visualgc tool will open two or three windows: the <a href="#VisualGC">
Visual GC</a> window, the <a href="#Graph">Graph</a> window, and optionally
the <a href="#SurvivorAgeHistogram">Survivor Age Histogram</a> window. The
Survivor Age Histogram window not only available when the Parallel Scagenge
collection (-XX:+UseParallelGC or -XX:+AggressiveHeap) is in use.

<a name="VisualGC">
<h2>Visual GC Window</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p>
The VisualGC window is upper leftmost window and is comprised of
two panels. The top panel, labeled <em>Application Information</em>
contains a liveness indicator and the elapsed time since the start of the
target Java application. It also contains a scrollable text area that
lists miscellaneous information about the configuration of the target
Java application and JVM. This section includes the target application's
main class name (or jar file if the application was started with the
<i>-jar</i> option), and the arguments to the class's <code>main</code>
method. It also includes the arguments passed to the JVM and the values
of certain Java properties exported as instrumentation objects.
<p>
The bottom panel provides a graphical view of the spaces that make up
the generational garbage collection system. This panel is divided up
unto three vertical sections, one for each of the of the generations:
the <em>Perm</em> (or Permanent) generation, the <em>Old</em> (or Tenured)
generation, and the Young generation.  The Young generation section is
comprised of three separate spaces that occupy the rightmost vertical
slice of this panel. The three spaces are the <em>Eden</em> space and
two Survivor spaces, <em>S0</em> and <em>S1</em>.
<p>
The screen areas representing the various spaces are sized proportionately
to the maximum capacities of the spaces. The screen areas for the three
generations are of fixed size and do not vary over time. Each space is
filled with a unique color indicating the current utilization of the space,
relative to its maximum capacity. The unique color for each space
is used consistently among this window and the <a href="#Graph">Graph</a> and
<a href="#SurvivorAgeHistogram">Survivor Age Histogram</a> windows.
<p>
The memory management system in the HotSpot JVM is capable of growing and
shrinking the garbage collected heap. This is accomplished by reserving
address space for the requested maximum heap size, but committing
real memory to only the amount currently needed. The relationship between
committed and reserved memory is represented by the color of the background
grid in each space. Uncommitted memory is represented by the dark gray
colored portion of the grid whereas committed memory is represented by
the green colored portion of the grid. In many cases, the utilization of
the space may be nearly identical to the committed amount of memory,
making it difficult to determine the exact transition point of the green
portion of the grid to the gray portion of the grid.
<p>
The relationship between the sizes of the Eden and Survivor spaces in the
young generation portion of the Visual GC frame are usually fixed in size.
The survivor spaces are of identical size and are fully committed, indicated
by the grid that is all green. The Eden space may be only partially committed,
with the uncommitted portion of the space represented by dark gray portion
of the grid.
<p>
When the parallel young generation collector (-XX:+UseParallelGC) is used
along with the adaptive size policy feature (-XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy),
the relationship between the sizes of the young generation spaces can vary
over time. When this collector policy is in effect, the sizes of the of
the survivor spaces are not necessarily identical and space in the young
generation can be dynamically redistributed among the three spaces. In this
configuration, the screen areas representing the Survivor spaces and the
colored region representing the utilization of the space are sized relative
to the current size of the space, not the maximum size of the space. When
dynamic resizing occurs, the screen area associated with the young generation
spaces will change accordingly.

<a name="Graph">
<h2>Graph Window</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The Graph window displays plots the values of various statistics as a
function of time.  The resolution of the horizontal axis of the graph
is determined by the <i>interval</i> command line argument, where each
sample occupies 2 pixels of screen area.  The height of each display
depends on the metric being plotted.
<p>
The following displays are provided
<dl>
     <dt><code>Compile Time</code>
         <dd>This panel plots the amount of time spent compiling Java byte
         codes into native code.  The height of this display is not scaled
         to any particular value. A non zero value in this graph indicates that
         compilation activity occurred during the last interval. A narrow pulse
         indicates a relatively short duration and a wide pulse indicates
         a long duration. The title bar indicates the number of compilation
         tasks and the accumulated compilation time since the start of the
         application.
         <p>
     <dt><code>Class Loader Time</code>
         <dd>This panel plots the amount of time spent in class loading and
         unloading activities.  The height of this display is not scaled
         to a particular value. A non zero value in this graph indicates that
         class loading activity occurred during the last interval. A narrow
         pulse indicates a relatively short duration and a wide pulse indicates
         a long duration. The title bar indicates the number of classes loaded
         and unloaded and the accumulated class loading time since the start
         of the application.
         <p>
     <dt><code>GC Time</code>
         <dd>This panel plots the amount of time spent in garbage collection
         activities.  The height of this display is not scaled to any
         particular value. A non zero value in this graph indicates that
         garbage collection activity occurred during the last interval. A
         narrow pulse indicates a relatively short duration and a wide pulse
         indicates a long duration.  The title bar indicates the total number
         of GC events and the accumulated GC time since the start of the
         application.
         <p>
         <dd> If the target JVM maintains the hotspot.gc.cause and
         hotspot.gc.last_cause counters, the cause of the GC events will
         also be displayed in the title bar for this graph.
         <p>
     <dt><code>Eden Space</code>
         <dd>This panel plots the utilization of the Eden Space over time. The
         Eden Space is one of three spaces that make up the Young Generation.
         The height of this panel is fixed and, by default,  the data is scaled
         according to the current capacity of the space. Since the current
         capacity of the space can change dynamically depending on the
         collector policy, visual artifacts may occur as the space shrinks and
         grows over time.
         <p>
         <dd> The title bar displays the name of the space and its maximum and
         current capacity in parenthesis followed by the current utilization
         of the space. In addition, the title also contains the number and
         accumulated time of Young GC events.
         <p>
     <dt><code>Survivor 0 and Survivor 1</code>
         <dd>The Survivor panels plot the utilization of the two survivor
          spaces over time. The Survivor Spaces are the remaining two spaces
          comprising the Young Generation. The height of each of these panels
          is fixed and, by default, the data is scaled according to the current
          capacity of the corresponding space. Since the current capacity of
          the survivor spaces can change dynamically depending on the collector
          policy, visual artifacts may occur as the space shrinks and grows
          over time.
          <p>
          <dd>
          The title bar displays the name of the space and its maximum and
          current capacity in parenthesis followed by the current utilization
          of the space.
         <p>
     <dt><code>Old Gen</code>
         <dd>The Old Gen panel plots the utilization of the Old Generation over
         time. The Old Generation is comprised of a single space. The height of
         the panel is fixed and, by default, the data is scaled according to
         the current capacity of the space. Since the current capacity of the
         space can change dynamically depending on the collector policy, visual
         artifacts may occur as the space shrinks and grows over time.
         <p>
         <dd> The title bar displays the name of the space and its maximum and
         current capacity in parenthesis followed by the current utilization
         of the space. In addition, the title also contains the number and
         accumulated time of Full GC events.
         <p>
     <dt><code>Perm Gen</code>
         <dd>The Perm Gen panel plots the utilization of the Permanent
         Generation over time.  The Permanent Generation is comprised of a
         single space, but does not have its own collector. Instead, this space
         is collected as part of the Old Generation. The height of the panel is
         fixed and, by default, the data is scaled according to the current
         capacity of the space. Since the current capacity of the space can
         change dynamically depending on the collector policy, visual artifacts
         may occur as the space shrinks and grows over time.
          <p>
          <dd>
          The title bar displays the name of the space and its maximum and
          current capacity in parenthesis followed by the current utilization
          of the space.
         <p>
</dl>
<p> Each of the GC space graphs can be displayed in one of two modes -
reserved mode or committed mode, with committed mode being the default. In
reserved mode, the data is scaled according to the maximum capacity of the
space while in committed mode, the data is scaled according to the current
capacity of the space. In reserved mode, the background grid is painted in
dark gray to represent that portion of the reserved memory that is uncommitted
memory and in green to represent the portion that is committed. The mode
can be toggled by right-clicking over the space and checking or un-checking
the "Show Reserved Space" check box.

<a name="SurvivorAgeHistogram">
<h2>Survivor Age Histogram Window</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The <em>Survivor Age Histogram</em> window is the lowermost window.
It is comprise of two panels, the <em>Parameters</em> panel and the
<em>Histogram</em> panel.
<p>
The <em>Parameters</em> panel displays the size of the survivor spaces
and the parameters that control the promotion behavior of the young
generation. After each young generation collection, objects that survive
the collection but are not promoted remain in the Survivor spaces. An
object's age is incremented each time it survives a young generation
collection until the object's age reaches the maximum age as defined by
the TenuringThreshold variable, which varies between 1 and
MaxTenuringThreshold-1 depending on the utilization of the survivor space.
If the survivor space overflows, then the oldest objects are promoted
to the Old generation until the utilization of the space does not
exceed DesiredSurvivorSize.  A MaxTenuringThreshold value of 0 will
result in objects always being promoted to the old generation and a
value 32 will prevent objects from being promoted unless the survivor
space fills up.
<p>
The <em>Histogram</em> panel displays a snapshot of the age distribution
of objects in the active survivor space after the last Young generation
collection. The display is comprised of 32 identically sized regions,
one for each possible object age. Each region represents 100% of the active
Survivor Space and is filled with a colored area that indicates the percentage
of the survivor space occupied by objects of the given age.
<p>
When the target JVM is started with the parallel young generation collector
(-XX:+UseParallelGC), the Survivor Age Histrogram window is not displayed.
The parallel young generation collector does not maintain a survivor age
histogram as it applies a different policy for maintaining objects in the
survivor spaces.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2></a>

<blockquote>
To monitor a local HotSpot JVM, its local virtual machine identifier
, or <i>lvmid</i> must first be determined. The <b>jps</b> command
should be used to determine the local virtual machine identifier for
the target JVM. Although a <i>lvmid</i> is simply a process identifier
on UNIX platforms and Windows platforms, acquiring a process identifier
from platform specific tools such as <b>ps</b> or Task Manager may not
be sufficient. In general, if the <b>jps</b> does not list the target
application in its output, then the target is not monitorable by the
user running the tools. Furthermore, operating systems other than UNIX
and Windows may not have such a direct mapping from an operating system
abstraction to an <i>lvmid</i>, in which case the operating system
specific tools may not be able to provide a corresponding identifier.
<p>
Once the <i>lvmid</i> has been determined, it can be used directly for
local monitoring or as a component of a more general

or <b>vmid</b>, for the <b>visualgc</b> command.

is RMI. This implication requires that an RMI registry bound to the
default port (1099) and the <i>jstatd</i> server are running on
<i>remote.domain</i>. In addition, it also assumes that the <i>jstatd</i>
server is running with appropriate credentials to access the JVM
itendified by <i>lvmid</i> 102592.

<h2>BUGS</h2></a>
<blockquote>
<p> The <i>visualgc</i> tool was originally developed as demonstration
software for JavaOne 2001 where it was used in a presentation to help
describe how various tunable parameters affect the operations of the
HotSpot generational garbage collector. This application was modified
to use the jvmstat APIs to acquire data from a live instrumented JVM.
<p> The future of this tool is unknown and bugs may or may not be fixed in
future releases. The tool may be replaced by a more generic, but configurable
tool that can provide similar information.
